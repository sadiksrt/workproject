Good day, my name is Sadik. I start my sentence by saying that this is the first time I have had difficulties in this project. Since I only work as a front end and desktop application, I don't know much about APIs. But I tried my best to do it. But in this project I could not pull the data from the api. When I want to check whether the API is working or not, my browser gave an unreachable error, so I am sending these codes to you. Sorry, it's the first time I've had such a hard time in a code and I still haven't been able to solve the errors. If you send a project without an API, I can make a website and send it to you in the best way possible. I wasn't very familiar with the API issue. Sadik.
